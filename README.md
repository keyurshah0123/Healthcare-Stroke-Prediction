# Healthcare-Stroke-Prediction-Data Analysis

• Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on HealthCare Stroke Dataset and found that around 7k People who formerly smoked have higher chance of stroke. Also analyze patterns between multiple cases. 

• Applied machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Analysis, Random Forest Boosting, XGBoost to support my hypothesis and further strengthen my claim

• Logistic Regression accuracy was 76.34 and by applying the Random forest classification accuracy improved to 98%
